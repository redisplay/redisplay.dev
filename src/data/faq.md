# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Redisplay?

Redisplay is an open-source Android application that transforms your old phones and tablets into beautiful, customizable smart displays. Instead of letting your devices collect dust or end up in a landfill, give them a new purpose as digital displays for your home or office.

## What Android versions are supported?

Redisplay is designed to work on Android 4 and later. This ensures compatibility with a wide range of devices, including older phones and tablets.

## Do I need an internet connection?

Basic modules can run without an internet connection, but most interesting and useful modules require internet access to fetch data like weather, news, calendars, and other online content. You can control your displays from any device on the same Wi-Fi network, and your data stays private and local.

## Can I create custom modules?

Yes! Redisplay is fully open-source and modular. You can create custom display modules or modify existing ones. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redisplay) for documentation and examples.

## Is Redisplay free?

Yes, Redisplay is completely free and open-source under the GPL License. You can use it, modify it, and contribute to it without any restrictions.

## How do I install Redisplay?

Download the APK from our website and install it on your Android device. Make sure to enable "Install from unknown sources" in your device settings if prompted.

## Can I use Redisplay on multiple devices?

Absolutely! You can install Redisplay on as many devices as you want. Each device can run independently or be controlled from a central device on your network.

## Does Redisplay drain battery quickly?

Redisplay is designed to be used with devices that are always connected to a power supply. The idea is to keep your old devices plugged in continuously, transforming them into permanent smart displays rather than portable devices. This ensures optimal performance and prevents battery degradation.

## How do I contribute to the project?

We welcome contributions! You can contribute code, report bugs, suggest features, or help with documentation. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redisplay) to get started.

## Is my data secure?

Yes! Redisplay runs entirely on your local network. No data is sent to external servers, and all communication happens within your home network. Your privacy is our priority.
